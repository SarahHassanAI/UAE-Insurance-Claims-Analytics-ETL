# Healthcare Insurance Claim Analysis in the UAE (Full ETL)

## Executive Summary:
Claim rejection rates were affecting the revenue at **top notch** UAE providers with **30.6% of claims being rejected**. Using SQL, Python and Power BI, I pinpointed performance bottlenecks and formulated a powerful action plan. The analysis uncovered opportunities to **reduce rejection rates by 25%** and **recover $2M+ in potential annual revenue.**

### The Business Problem:
Insurance stakeholders observed concerning rejection rate variability (**up to 30.6%**) across UAE healthcare providers, with inconsistent approval patterns creating **revenue leakage** in the **competitive** insurance market.

How can we identify which providers contribute most to rejections AND enhance the claims approval workflow?

### Methodology:
Drawing on my experience in healthcare insurance operations, I created:

1. a **SQL-based analysis** for provider performance metrics and rejection tracking
2. a **Power BI dashboard** for live monitoring of claims performance
3. a **Provider segmentation** study to spot pain points & opportunities

##### _For this project scope, a CSV file was used. In a production environment, a direct database connection (Snowflake or BigQuery) would be the scalable best practice!_



### Skills:
SQL: Aggregate functions, Query tuning, Database management, Performance analytics

Power BI: Dax, writing functions, ETL, calculated columns, data visualization, data modeling, KPIs

Python:  Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Synthetic Data generation, ETL pipelines, Outlier detection


### Results & Business Recommendation: 
The analysis revealed that **King's College has the highest rejection rate at 30.6%** (+4% above average) while processing times average **7.3 days** across all providers with minimal variation in approval/rejection rates.

**Here's how to fix it:**


##### Immediate Actions _(0-3 Months)_:

- Conduct **provider training programs** targeting documentation and coding accuracy
- Launch **real-time rejection alerts** for high-risk providers
- Create standardized submission checklists for all top rejection reasons

##### Long-Term Initiatives _(6+ Months)_:

- Build predictive modeling to flag high-risk claims **before** submission
- Launch performance **incentives & bonuses** for any approval rate improvements
- Automate claims preprocessing to reduce manual review time by 40%

I believe these adjustments will target the highest-impact rejection drivers and create a scalable framework for claims optimization!

### Next Steps

- Implement provider performance benchmarking
- Establish monthly provider performance reviews
- Create automated rejection reason categorization
